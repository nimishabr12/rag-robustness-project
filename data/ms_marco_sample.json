        "The cost of sales, also referred to as the cost of goods sold, is a measure of how much it costs a company to sell its products. The cost of sales is also a necessary step when a business is trying to determine the amount of gross profit made in a given period. Not every company calculates cost of sales the same way.",
        "The cost of sales is one of the fundamental metrics by which small business owners can gauge profit or loss. In the simplest of terms, subtracting the cost of your sales from the amount you receive from your sales will tell you how much money you make, or your gross profit in accounting terms.",
        "Cost of sales does not include indirect expenses such as distribution costs and marketing costs. It appears on the income statement and is deducted from the sales revenue for the calculation of gross profit (or gross margin).",
        "Definition: Cost of Goods Sold, (COGS), can also be referred to as cost of sales (COS), cost of revenue, or product cost, depending on if it is a product or service. It includes all the costs directly involved in producing a product or delivering a service. These costs can include labor, material, and shipping.",

It includes the cost of the direct materials used in producing the goods, direct labor costs used to produce the good, along with any other direct costs associated with the production of goods.",
        "The cost of sales is the accumulated total of all costs used to create a product or service, which has been sold. The term is most commonly used by retailers. A manufacturer is more likely to use the term cost of goods sold."

The works continued to use the bright Impressionist palette, but rejected the Impressionism’s emphasis on the spontaneous recording of light and color. Post-Impressionists sought to create art with a greater degree of formal order and structure.",
        "Their pictures are very bright and vibrant. The artists like to capture their images without detail but with bold colors. Some of the greatest impressionist artists were Edouard Manet, Camille Pissaro, Edgar Degas, Alfred Sisley, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot and Pierre Auguste Renoir. Manet influenced the development of impressionism. He painted everyday objects. ",
        "Impression, Sunrise (French: Impression, soleil levant) is a painting by Claude Monet. Shown at what would later be known as the Exhibition of the Impressionists in April 1874, the painting is attributed to giving rise to the name of the Impressionist movement. ",
        "The artists held their first exhibition in 1874, calling themselves an anonymous group.. The show drew a storm of criticism from the press and the public. One critic mockingly called the artists' work impressionism, taking the term from the title of Monet's painting Impression: Sunrise. The critic meant that the paintings were only impressions, sketchy and incomplete. After 1875, impressionism became widely accepted and began to influence artists in other European countries. Prominent painters outside France added elements of impressionism to their work. They included Germany's Max Liebermann, Italy's Giuseppi De Nittis, and England's Wilson Steer.",
        "Impression: Sunrise, Claude Monet, 1874. Impressionism takes its name from this painting, one of the initial works exhibited by artists in Paris who were dubbed by critics, “painters of mere impressions.”. The first exhibition, in 1874, featured Claude Monet’s Impression: Sunrise, prompting hostile critics to dismiss them all as. “painters of mere impressions.” The implication is that these artists are incapable of producing a properly composed and finished painting. Lavacourt under the Snow, Claude Monet, 1878-81.",
        "Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement that originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s. Musical Impressionism is the name given to a movement in European classical music that arose in the late 19th century and continued into the middle of the 20th century.",
        "Impressionism is a genre of art in which the artist is trying to capture a fleeting moment, feeling or impression. It was characterized by loosely painted brush strokes, dabs of color that blended together to form an image (pointillism), sketchy lines and transitory lighting effects. That is not to say that there are no flaws with Impressionism, it is still a human creation and therefore fallible, but it is difficult to discern whether the criticisms against it are based out of a critics personal opinion or fact.",
        "Impressionism is a 19th century artistic movement that swept much of the painting and sculpture styles of the period. It was not just a passing fad but has defined an entirely modern way of expressing one’s artistry that eventually rubbed off in other art forms like literature and photography. ",
        "He died in 1926. Still, we can say that Impressionism as a style continues in the work of some artists to this very day. Some artists who exhibited with the Impressionists in the 1870s and 1880s pushed their art into different directions. Impressionism is about the temporary, the here and now, and not about the timeless, the forever. Impressionism is about life lived in bursts of brief encounters in the city. It's about faster speeds, quickly moving clouds, sunshine reflected on water, and the shimmer of satin ribbons dangling from a baby's cradle."

        "Can bean straw be put out for horses? They have regular hay, to eat, but thought maybe they could use the bean straw to lay on. Also wanted to put it in the building they go into to give the floor some cushion. Will it hurt them if they eat it?",

        "It is important to create a continuous covering with bean straw mulch so that the soil is not visible. Ideally a minimum ground covering of approximately 50 mm - 80 mm is desirable. However, we recommend that you don't hold back, as creating a thick layer is an excellent method to retain soil moisture.",
        "I don't think any research has been done on bean straw specifically. However, like most other straw, it is a good bedding source and as long as horses have plenty of good quality hay to eat they should not be consuming the straw."

        "For that reason, a deficiency in iodine can lead to an underactive thyroid. However, a lack of iodine is rarely the cause of hypothyroidism in developed countries where it is abundant in the food supply (3). Nevertheless, including iodine-rich foods in your diet is a good idea to be safe. Summary: As iodine is required for thyroid hormone production, ensure your diet contains foods naturally rich in iodine (but if you have Hashimoto’s then check first with your doctor). Unless you are pregnant or breastfeeding, iodine supplements are unnecessary and potentially dangerous.",

Symptoms of whooping cough vary. Early in the infection, the symptoms resemble those of a cold; 1  mild fever, 2  nasal congestion,",
        "A. A. Whooping cough (also known as pertussis) is a bacterial infection that gets into your nose and throat. It spreads very easily, but vaccines like DTaP and Tdap can help prevent it in children and adults. ",
        "PATHOGENICITY/TOXICITY: B. pertussis is a respiratory pathogen that causes pertussis, also known as whooping cough, a localized infection of the ciliated epithelium of the bronchial tree. The disease affects mainly children, but adults have also been increasingly reported to be affected. SYNONYM OR CROSS REFERENCE: Originally named Haemophilus pertussis F, Whooping cough. CHARACTERISTICS: Bordetella pertussis are small, gram-negative, encapsulated, non-motile, coccobacilli with outer pili.",
        "Whooping cough (pertussis) facts. 1  Whooping cough (pertussis) is an acute, highly contagious respiratory infection that is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. 2  Whooping cough commonly affects infants and young children but can be prevented by immunization with the pertussis vaccine. The term whooping cough is based on the characteristic noise made as the person at the end of a coughing attack that sounds like a high-pitched whoop as the person tries to suck in a breath. Symptoms of whooping cough vary. Early in the infection, the symptoms resemble those of a cold; 1  mild fever, 2  nasal congestion,",
        "Details of clinical diagnosis (taken from my thesis). Whooping cough in a recognizable form evolves over a period of 2 weeks. It usually starts as a sore throat with a mild feeling of tiredness and being unwell, that within 2 or 3 days turns into a (usually) dry, intermittent ordinary cough. The one characteristic of whooping cough that make it different is the LONG INTERVALS OF NO COUGHING (often hours) between paroxysms of coughing. Only about 50% of whooping cough sufferers 'whoop' but this is where the name comes from."

        "Climate, sometimes understood as the average weather,” is defined as the measurement of the mean and variability of relevant quantities of certain variables (such as temperature, precipitation or wind) over a period of time, ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. Climate variability is measured by these deviations, which are usually termed anomalies. Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate system (internal variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external factors (external variability).",
        "The ocean is a significant influence on Earth's weather and climate. The ocean covers 70% of the global surface. This great reservoir continuously exchanges heat, moisture, and carbon with the atmosphere, driving our weather patterns and influencing the slow, subtle changes in our climate. 1 Climate is also influenced by the biological pump, a biological process in the ocean that impacts concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 2  The oceanic biological productivity is both a source and sink of carbon dioxide, one of the greenhouse gases that control climate.",

In unstable conditions, a lifted parcel of air will be warmer than the surrounding air at altitude. These indices, as well as atmospheric instability itself, involve temperature changes through the troposphere with height, or lapse rate. Effects of atmospheric instability in moist atmospheres include thunderstorm development, which over warm oceans can lead to tropical cyclogenesis, and turbulence.",

        "by Fraser Cain on May 15, 2008. Pluto takes 6 days and 9 hours to complete one rotation, so this is how long a day is on Pluto. You can also look through these books from Amazon.com if you want more information about Pluto. One interesting note is that Pluto’s moon Charon is tidally locked around Pluto. This means that Charon takes 6 days and 9 hours to orbit around Pluto – the same amount of time it takes for a day on Pluto. This means that Charon is always at the same place in the sky when seen from Pluto. You would have the same view from Charon as well",

Generally, it is left up to the parent to decide whether a child who is at least eight is mature enough to be home alone. Any time you leave your child alone, be sure the child knows what to do in case of an emergency.",
        "Basically, if your child is age seven or younger, they should never be left alone. Kids ages 8-10 can be alone briefly, and ages 10-13 for longer periods, provided there is back-up supervision. Babysitters should be at least 12-13 years old, and can babysit for longer periods as they grow older. Again, this is a very individual decision, and these ages are only general guidelines. You need to decide if your child is mature enough.",

        "Older Children. If you are looking to babysit for older children, say from age 10 and up, you will want to be much older than the child. Depending on the length of the sitting, you should be about 4 years older than the older child you’re sitting for. For instance, if the parents of a 10 year old are going out for a movie and want someone to watch the child, a good minimum age for a sitter would be 14.",
        "However, if you are under 16 years old it is against the law for you to babysit during school hours without permission from your principal.

Evolution is the process by which living creatures change gradually over time. It was suggested by Charles Darwin, who also came up with a brilliant idea about the reason that living beings change in this way.",

You typically need two to three years of experience before you can take the Principles and Practice of Engineering exam, a test that measures your knowledge of advanced engineering topics. Those who pass this test become professional engineers or PEs."

The cell has a pale rounded nucleus surrounded by a cytoplasm in which mitochondria are intermingled with the Nissl bodies. Pyramidal cells are excitatory neurons and have spiny apical and basal dendrites. However in large neurons such as the Betz cell of motor cortex and the Meynert cells of visual cortex there is a substantial increase in the frequency of lipofuscin granules (Fig. 1.4). Lipofuscin is known as one of the aging “wear and tear” pigments.",
        "Chapter 1 – neuronal cell bodies. Functionally, there are two basic types of neurons in the cerebral cortex, excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The excitatory neurons are the pyramidal and spiny stellate neurons, the dendrites of which are covered by dendritic spines. However in large neurons such as the Betz cell of motor cortex and the Meynert cells of visual cortex there is a substantial increase in the frequency of lipofuscin granules (Fig. 1.4). Lipofuscin is known as one of the aging “wear and tear” pigments.",
        "The dorsal root is sensory (all neurons conduct impulses into the spinal cord) while the ventral root is motor (all neurons conduct impulses out of the spinal cord). The dorsal root has a ganglion that contains the cell bodies of the sensory neurons that pass through the dorsal root. Somatic efferent neurons are motor neurons that conduct impulses from the spinal cord to skeletal muscles. These neurons are multipolar neurons, with cell bodies located in the gray matter of the spinal cord. Somatic efferent neurons leave the spinal cord through the ventral root of spinal nerves. Visceral afferent neurons are sensory neurons that conduct impulses initiated in receptors in smooth muscle & cardiac muscle",
        "gray matter-an area of unmyelinated neurons where cell bodies and synapses occur. In the spinal cord the synapses between sensory and motor and interneurons occurs in the gray matter. The cell bodies of the interneurons and motor neurons also are found in the gray matter. white matter-an area of myelinated fiber tracts. Myelination in the CNS differs from that in nerves. A nerve does not contain cell bodies. They are located in the ganglion (sensory) or in the gray matter (motor). tract-a group of fibers inside the CNS. The spinal tracts carry information up or down the spinal cord, to or from the brain.",
        "Cerebral Cortex The cerebral cortex is the outer surface of the cerebral hemispheres. It is the highest level of the brain and has about 20 billion neurons in the human brain which carry out the highest levels of mental functioning. The cerebral cortex is a layer of grey matter up to about 1/2 cm thick. Figure 3-2d shows a cross section of the cerebral hemispheres with the cortex shown as the pink layer on their outer surface. Figure 4-2d shows a highly magnified slice through the cortex. It is stained with a dye that colors (only) the cell bodies of neurons and glia blue. This shows the densely packed neurons form six layers, each with different functions and connections. Figure 3-2d. Cross-section of cerebral hemispheres, just in front of the brain stem. The pink outer layer is the cerebral cortex. The pink areas inside the hemispheres are areas of grey matter called nuclei. The white matter between these nuclei and the cortex contains the axons of neurons connecting the neurons in these different areas",
        "The cerebral cortex is the cerebrum 's (brain) outer layer of neural tissue in humans and other mammals. It is divided into two cortices, along the sagittal plane: the left and right cerebral hemispheres divided by the medial longitudinal fissure. In the human brain more than two-thirds of the cerebral cortex is buried in the sulci. The cerebral cortex is gray matter, consisting mainly of cell bodies (with astrocytes being the most abundant cell type in the cortex as well as the human brain as a whole) and capillaries. It contrasts with the underlying white matter, consisting mainly of the white myelinated sheaths of neuronal axons",
        "Most of the cell bodies of neurons in the cerebral cortex of the monkey show few obvious alterations with age beyond a slight increase in the frequency of lipofuscin granules and this tends to be more apparent in inhibitory neurons (Fig.1.3) than in excitatory ones (Figs. 1.1; Fig. 1.1A; Fig. 1.2).

        "These 10 animal facts will amaze you. Titration is a method used commonly in chemistry laboratories and classrooms, which uses a solution of a known concentration to analyze and determine the unknown concentration of a second solution. A textbook setup for an acid-base titration involves the solution of known concentration, called the titrant, suspended in a buret above a flask containing the unknown solution, or titrand. The buret is a calibrated vertical tube with a stopcock at the bottom of it to regulate the flow of the titrant into the flask",
        "What is a Titration. A titration is a technique where a solution of known concentration is used to determine the concentration of an unknown solution. Typically, the titrant (the know solution) is added from a buret to a known quantity of the analyte (the unknown solution) until the reaction is complete. ",
        "Titration, also known as titrimetry, is a common laboratory method of quantitative chemical analysis that is used to determine the unknown concentration of an identified analyte. Since volume measurements play a key role in titration, it is also known as volumetric analysis. A reagent, called the titrant or titrator is prepared as a standard solution. A known concentration and volume of titrant reacts with a solution of analyte or titrand to determine concentration. An assay is a form of biological titration used to determine the concentration of a virus or bacterium. Serial dilutions are performed on a sample in a fixed ratio (such as 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, etc.) until the last dilution does not give a positive test for the presence of the virus.",
        "Titration is a procedure used in chemistry in order to determine the molarity of an acid or a base. A chemical reaction is set up between a known volume of a solution of unknown concentration and a known volume of a solution with a known concentration. When the solution of known concentration and the solution of unknown concentration are reacted to the point where the number of acid equivalents equals the number of base equivalents (or vice versa), the equivalence point is reached. The equivalence point of a strong acid or a strong base will occur at pH 7.",
        "Typical Titration Apparatus. In a titration, a solution of unknown concentration is reacted with a solution of a known concentration in order to find out more about the unknown solution. Animated Acid-Base Titration. Two of the most common titrations are acid-base and redox titrations. In an acid-base titration one of the solutions is an acid and the other a base.",
        "Titration Definition: Titration is the process in which one solution is added to another solution such that it reacts under conditions in which the added volume may be accurately measured. Titrations are most commonly associated with acid-base reaction, but they may involve other types of reactions as well. ",
        "Titration is a laboratory method used to determine the unknown concentration of a reactant. This is a delicate procedure that requires patience and a good observation skills. Usually, an indicator is used in titration to determine the endpoint of the reaction. Once the endpoint volume is found, mathematics can be used to determine the concentration of the unknown. This procedure is commonly used in the field of analytical chemistry",
        "A titration is a method of analysis that will allow you to determine the precise endpoint of a reaction and therefore the precise quantity of reactant in the titration flask. A buret is used to deliver the second reactant to the flask and an indicator or pH Meter is used to detect the endpoint of the reaction. ",
        "The Titration Experiment. Titration is a general class of experiment where a known property of one solution is used to infer an unknown property of another solution. In acid-base chemistry, we often use titration to determine the pH of a certain solution. A setup for the titration of an acid with a base is shown in : Figure %: A titration setup. We use this instrumentation to calculate the amount of unknown acid in the receiving flask by measuring the amount of base, or titrant, it takes to neutralize the acid."

Trimmings can be used for stocks, soups, purees, etc. The measurement for julienne is ⅛ x ⅛ x 1 to 2 in (3 mm x 3 mm x 3 to 5 cm). Julienne usually applies to vegetables prepared in this way but it can also be applied to the preparation of meat or fish, especially in stir fry techniques."

Accidental hypothermia usually happens after cold temperature exposure without enough warm, dry clothing for protection.",

        "Prior to the onset of hypothermia the body maintains a relatively stable temperature whereby heat production is balanced by heat loss. When the outside environment gets too cold or the body's heat production decreases, hypothermia occurs (hypo=less + thermia=temperature). Body temperature is controlled in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which is responsible for recognizing alterations in the body temperature and responding appropriately."

        "Decaffeinated Tea refers to black or green tea that has had most of its natural caffeine removed. It's important to note that decaffeinated does not mean caffeine-free . There is still a small amount of caffeine in most decaffeinated teas unless the product is highly processed. Decaffeinated Black Tea can contain about 4-6mg of caffeine per tea bag.",
        "When your coffee label states that the beans are naturally decaffeinated, it is referring to this process, specifically using ethyl acetate. Although it doesn't sound like a natural process, it can be labeled as such because the solvent occurs in nature. If your coffee is labeled naturally decaffeinated or Swiss water processed, you can be assured that no harmful chemicals are used. If you are uncertain, you can ask or call your coffee processor to learn about the method used.",
        "Decaffeinated tea is a great option for tea lovers who wish to avoid much of the caffeine naturally found in the tea leaf. All forms of tea (black, oolong, green, white, and pu-erh) can be decaffeinated; but really only black and green tea are regularly decaffeinated. It must be noted that decaffeinated tea is NOT caffeine free. The decaffeination process leaves a minute amount of caffeine in the leaf. ",
        "Photos.com/PhotoObjects.net/Getty Images. Naturally decaffeinated coffee may mean a variety of things. However, coffee producers do not necessarily have to disclose in what way the coffee was decaffeinated, even if it says naturally decaffeinated on the label. The most common methods of removing caffeine are the Swiss Water method, methyl chloride and ethyl acetate. In 2004 a coffee plant which naturally contains little or no caffeine was discovered by researchers in Brazil. The hope is that this plant can be crossed with already commercially popular varieties of coffee to produce beans that are decaffeinated without the need for any process to remove the caffeine.",
        "The most commonly available decaffeinated green tea is naturally decaffeinated. It is made using a chemical solvent called ethyl acetate. During this process, tea leaves are soaked in water to release caffeine and other tea compounds. Tea leaves are soaked in a carbon dioxide solution to release caffeine. This is followed by separating the tea leaves from the solution, and filtering out the caffeine using active carbon or charcoal. Finally tea leaves are re-immersed into the solution to reabsorb the lost tea nutrients.",
        "The naturally decaffeinated simply means that we employ a non chemical process with pure effervescence to remove the caffeine content of our tea to maximize the antioxidant level. The process is 100 % non-chemical and safe. The result is a full-bodied, richly colored and highly aromatic tea. ",
        "For a tea to be legally labeled decaffeinated in the United States, 98% of the caffeine must be removed. This means one cup should contain less than 5 milligram of caffeine or 0.4% in dry weight. For caffeine sensitive individuals, drinking decaffeinated tea may seem an ideal way to enjoy tea health benefits without its side effects. Unfortunately, things do not quite work out this way. Tea leaves are soaked in a carbon dioxide solution to release caffeine. This is followed by separating the tea leaves from the solution, and filtering out the caffeine using active carbon or charcoal. Finally tea leaves are re-immersed into the solution to reabsorb the lost tea nutrients.",
        "Decaffeination is the removal of caffeine from coffee beans, cocoa, tea leaves and other caffeine-containing materials. Decaffeination processes for coffee [edit]. In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is performed on unroasted (green) beans and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected.",

        "Best Answer: Tea (White, Green, and Black) can be decaffeinated right at home. All you have to do is put your tea leaves in your infuser and put it in a mug. Boil your water to the correct temperature for the tea that you are going to brew. Pour the water on the leaves so it covers them. Leave it for 30 seconds only. Remove the infuser from the mug. Throw the water out that is in the mug"

        "The Cerebrum: The cerebrum or cortex is the largest part of the human brain, associated with higher brain function such as thought and action. The cerebral cortex is divided into four sections, called lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe. ",
        "Several areas of the parietal lobe are important in language processing. The somatosensory cortex can be illustrated as a distorted figure — the homunculus (Latin : little man), in which the body parts are rendered according to how much of the somatosensory cortex is devoted to them. Within each hemisphere, the somatosensory cortex represents the skin area on the contralateral surface of the body. Immediately posterior to the central sulcus, and the most anterior part of the parietal lobe, is the postcentral gyrus (Brodmann area 3), the primary somatosensory cortical area.",
        "Location and Function of the Occipital Lobe. The occipital lobe is located in the posterior, or back, region of the cerebrum, superior to, or above, the cerebellum. It's protected by cranial bones, with the primary protective bone being the occipital bone. The cerebrum is the largest portion of the brain and is responsible for multiple bodily functions. The occipital lobe of the cerebrum is a major structural region. This article discusses the location and function of this key region of the cerebrum.",

As a part of the cortex, it has a lot of responsibilities and has to be able to process sensory information within seconds. The parietal lobe is where information such as taste, temperature and touch are integrated, or processed. Humans would not be able to to feel sensations of touch, if the parietal lobe was damaged.",
        "Let's review. The brain is divided into lobes. The parietal lobe is at the back of the brain and is divided into two hemispheres. It functions in processing sensory information regarding the location of parts of the body as well as interpreting visual information and processing language and mathematics. Functions of the Parietal Lobe. The parietal lobe functions in processing sensory information from the various parts of the body. It is heavily related to the sense of touch and involved in the manipulation of objects, as well as in detecting the orientation and numbers of objects encountered.",
        "Parietal lobe. The parietal lobe is located near the center of the brain, behind the frontal lobe, in front of the occipital lobe, and above the temporal lobe. The parietal lobe contains an area known as the primary sensory area. This is where impulses from the skin, such as warmth, cold, pain, and touch, are interpreted. The parietal lobe is also an essential element of spatial information, which gives us the ability to judge size, distance, and shapes. A specific triangular-shaped area known as the parietal association cortex gives us the ability to understand written language and solve mathematical problems.",
        "The brain is divided into several lobes. These lobes are anatomical regions that are marked by specific boundary points and are associated with certain processes that they influence or completely control.

        "This has not been the case with the Quechua language. Quechua is a language that has been spoken in the Andes region of South America since before the days of the Inca Empire. Speakers of this ancient Andean language can be found in Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, as well as Argentina. ",
        "You may have heard of Quechua as the language of the Incas. You may not know, until you finish this sentence, that it's the most widely spoken Amerindian language, with over 8 million speakers. In Peru, a quarter of the population speaks Quechua, and about a third of the Quechua speakers speak no Spanish. ",
        "Answer by NUCLEARxWARFARE. Confidence votes 42. The language the Incas spoke was called Quechua, pronounced like 'catch-wa'. Quechua still exists as a language today in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru with 10.4 million speakers. --. some of them also spoke a language known as Aymara which is similar to Quechua.",
        "Quechua was very distinctive language. Inca were very accurate in their language. The only imperfection that the Inca language had was that it did not have a written language. This would have really affected many of the Inca citizens. Quechua was under a certain procedure of only oral communication.",
        "Yes, the Incas spoke Quechua, and yes, they spoke a form of Quechua very similar to modern Cuzco Quechua. But no, the Incas did not speak the Original Quechua, and they only took their particular form of Quechua to a few of the regions in the Andes where it was spoken today. Most regions had long had their own Quechua, every bit as original, indigenous and true as the Quechua spoken today in Cuzco. Quechua was the official language of the Inca Empire, who ruled much of the Andes region from the mid-1400s until the arrival of Spanish conquistadors in 1532. The Spanish banned the Quechua language and culture from politics and education.",
        "The language the Incas spoke was called Quechua, pronounced like 'catch-wa'. Quechua still exists as a language today in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru … with 10.4 million speakers. -- some of them also spoke a language known as Aymara which is similar to Quechua. 23 people found this useful. ",
        "Quechua had already expanded across wide ranges of the central Andes long before the expansion of the Inca Empire. The Inca were just one among many peoples in present-day Peru who already spoke forms of Quechua. In the Cuzco region, Quechua was influenced by local languages such as Aymara. The Cuzco variety of Quechua developed as quite distinct.",
        "It is indeed a great pity that the Incas never had the opportunity, as did the Greeks and Romans, to come in contact with a people like the Phoenicians who were clever enough to invent an alphabet. The language of the Incas was the Quichua or Quechua tongue. Originally it was used only in a small area around Cuzco where the Inca dynasty originated, possibly in the tenth or eleventh century. During the next five hundred years, when the Incas succeeded in subduing the native races as far north as Ecuador and as far south as Argentina, they carried the Quechua language with them and insisted in its being learned by the conquered peoples so that it had a wide distribution by the end of the sixte",
        "The Inca kings of Cuzco made Quechua their official language. With the Inca conquest of Peru in the 14th century, Quechua became Peru’s lingua franca. The Inca Empire flourished in what is today’s Peru from 1438 to 1533 AD. Although the empire lasted only about 100 years, the Incas spread Quechua to areas that today are Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 16th century AD, Quechua had already spread throughout a large portion of the South American continent. The languages continued to spread into areas that were not part of the Inca empire such as Colombia, Brazil, and Argentina."

        "Leaf Tissue Organization The plant body is divided into several organs: roots, stems, and leaves. The leaves are the primary photosynthetic organs of plants, serving as key sites where energy from light is converted into chemical energy. Ground tissue comprises the bulk of a plant leaf and is generally comprised of a variety of cell types, the predominant of which are parenchyma. Often less specialized than other plant cell types, parenchyma cells are surrounded by thin, flexible primary walls and execute most of the plant s metabolic activities.",
        "The parenchyma cells present in leaves contain chloroplasts, which are the sites of photosynthesis. In Figure 1, the mesophyll is divided into two conspicuously different regions, a characteristic common among the leaves of many dicotyledons. Ground tissue comprises the bulk of a plant leaf and is generally comprised of a variety of cell types, the predominant of which are parenchyma. Often less specialized than other plant cell types, parenchyma cells are surrounded by thin, flexible primary walls and execute most of the plant s metabolic activities.",
        "Parenchyma | Back to Top. A generalized plant cell type, parenchyma cells are alive at maturity. They function in storage, photosynthesis, and as the bulk of ground and vascular tissues. Palisade parenchyma cells are elogated cells located in many leaves just below the epidermal tissue. Spongy mesophyll cells occur below the one or two layers of palisade cells. Ray parenchyma cells occur in wood rays, the structures that transport materials laterally within a woody stem. ",
        "9.1.3 Explain the relationship between the distribution of tissues in the leaf and the functions of these tissues. Upper epidermis-Consists of a single layer of cells found on the upper surface of the leaf. It is covered by a thick waxy cuticle. The main function of the upper epidermis is water conservation. It prevents the loss of water from the upper surface where the light intensity and heat are the greatest. Spongy mesophyll-Made up of loosely packed cells. This tissue is found in the lower half of the leaf (lower surface) and has few chloroplasts. It provides gas exchange (CO 2 uptake and O 2 release) and therefore needs to be close to the stomata found in the lower epidermis."

        "Carbon monoxide can kill. The gas forms when there is not enough oxygen to produce carbon dioxide -- essentially when the carbon in fuel is not burned completely. Carbon monoxide prevents oxygen in the blood from being carried throughout the body, causing asphyxiation.",
        "Carbon monoxide inhibits the blood's ability to carry oxygen to body tissues including vital organs such as the heart and brain. When CO is inhaled, it combines with the oxygen carrying hemoglobin of the blood to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) . Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, tasteless and toxic gas produced as a by-product of combustion. Any fuel burning appliance, vehicle, tool or other device has the potential to produce dangerous levels of carbon monoxide gas. Examples of carbon monoxide producing devices commonly in use around the home include:",
        "When you breathe in carbon monoxide, the CO also binds to hemoglobin. It binds so strongly that is keeps oxygen from binding as well. Over time, if you breathe enough carbon monoxide, it binds to all of the hemoglobin in your body, and you no longer have enough oxygen in your blood. Carbon monoxide and oxygen molecules both have 2 atoms. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin in our red blood cells [erythrocytes is their scientific name]. With carbon monoxide bound to hemoglobin where oxygen is supposed to bind, our bodies don't get the oxygen they need.",
        "The goal of treating CO poisoning is to remove the carbon monoxide from the haemoglobin in the blood as quickly as possible to return to body's oxygen levels to normal. The first step in treating carbon monoxide poisoning is to remove the patient plus any friends or relatives from the source of CO. Carbon monoxide can severely affect the central nervous system and people with cardiovascular disease. Carbon monoxide leaves the brain struggling for sufficient levels of oxygen and this in turn affects the heart, brain and central nervous system.",
        "Carbon Monoxide, when in the body, takes the place of oxygen. It affects. hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the red blood cells. Hemoglobin is an iron molecule that is complexed. The carbon monoxide complexes the iron limiting its oxygen carrying capability. This causes brain damage and the body to slow down and suffocation. Because Carbon Monoxide binds to haemoglobin much more easily than oxygen does, it displaces the oxygen molecules which means that the body tissues do not receive any oxygen-leading to suffocation of the cells.   A person who has been exposed to Carbon Monoxide will have a headache, nausea and vomiting.",
        "The respiratory system struggles to distribute air around the body because carbon monoxide deprives the blood cells of oxygen. This results in shortness of breath, particularly when undertaking strenuous activities. Carbon monoxide can severely affect the central nervous system and people with cardiovascular disease. Carbon monoxide leaves the brain struggling for sufficient levels of oxygen and this in turn affects the heart, brain and central nervous system.",
        "Carbon monoxide (CO) prevents the blood system from effectively carrying oxygen around the body, specifically to vital organs such as the heart and brain. High doses of CO, therefore, can cause death from asphyxiation or lack of oxygen to the brain. Carbon monoxide can severely affect the central nervous system and people with cardiovascular disease. Carbon monoxide leaves the brain struggling for sufficient levels of oxygen and this in turn affects the heart, brain and central nervous system.",
        "What You Should Know About Combustion Appliances. The most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. High levels of carbon monoxide ingestion can cause loss of consciousness and death. Unless suspected, carbon monoxide poisoning can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms mimic other illnesses. People who are sleeping or intoxicated can die from carbon monoxide poisoning before ever experiencing symptoms. ",
        "After breathing in carbon monoxide, it enters your bloodstream and mixes with haemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carry oxygen around your body), to form carboxyhaemoglobin. When this happens, the blood is no longer able to carry oxygen, and this lack of oxygen causes the body’s cells and tissue to die. "

One of these purposes is the Technetium-99m Generator.Technetium-99m, a man made element and a type of technetium isotope, has been used as a radioisotope since 1958. Since all isotopes of technetium are radioactive so is technetium-99m. The radioisotope is used to diagnose diseased organs. The injection of the technetium-99m isotope gives off a certain type of radiation which show doctors which areas of the organ is diseased without causing radiation damage to the patient.",
        "Technetium-99m can be readily detected in the body by medical equipment because it emits 140.5 keV gamma rays (these are about the same wavelength as emitted by conventional X-ray diagnostic equipment), and its half-life for gamma emission is six hours (meaning 94% of it decays to 99 Tc in 24 hours). Technetium-99m was discovered as a product of cyclotron bombardment of molybdenum. This procedure produced molybdenum-99, a radionuclide with a longer half-life (2.75 days), which decays to Tc-99m. At present, molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) is used commercially as the easily transportable source of medically used Tc-99m.",

Technetium-99, has a very long half-life (2.11 X 10 5 years) and decays almost entirely by beta decay with no gamma rays. It is used as for equipment calibration. Uses of Technetium. Technetium-99m is a metastable isotope with a half-life of six hours. Technetium-99m emits gamma rays and low energy electrons, forming technetium-99 (half-life 211 000 years).",
        "Technetium-99m. Technetium -99m is a widely used radioactive tracer isotope in Nuclear Medicine. It's gamma ray energy of about 140 keV is convenient for detection. The fact that both its physical half-life and its biological half-life are very short leads to very fast clearing from the body after an imaging process. Since 99 Mo is a fission product of 235 U fission, it can be separated from the other fission products and used to generate 99m Tc. For medical purposes, the 99m Tc is used in the form of pertechnate, TcO 4 - . The technetium isotope 99m Tc is unusual in that it has a half-life for gamma emission of 6.03 hours.",

        "For dry-type transformers having a 220 [degrees] C insulating system and a winding hot-spot temperature of 220 [degrees] C, and with no unusual operating conditions present, the 20-yr life expectancy is a reasonable time frame. The 80 [degrees] C transformer requires operation at 75% or more of full load for a 2-yr payback, and at 100% load to payback in 1 yr over the 150 [degrees] C transformer.",
        "The temperature rise of a transformer is due to the power loss dissipated by the transformer in the form of heat. The power loss of a transformer consists of core loss and of winding coil losses, and can be predicted accurately. With these assumptions, the temperature rise of a transformer can be estimated by the following formula: δT = (Pσ/A T) 0.833. Where: δT = temperature rise in °C. Pσ = total transformer losses (power lost and dissipated as heat) in mW; A T = surface area of transformer in cm 2.",
        "For start-up temperatures below –20°C (–4°F), it is recommended to energize the transformer, hold at no-load for at least 2 hours and slowly increase the load in 25% increments, allowing a minimum of 30 minutes between each increase. ",
        "You should note that at loadings below 50% of full load, there is essentially no payback for either the 115 [degrees] C or the 80 [degrees] C transformer over the 150 [degrees] C transformer. Also, at loadings below 40%, the lower temperature rise transformers become less efficient than the 150 [degrees] C transformers. The 80 [degrees] C transformer requires operation at 75% or more of full load for a 2-yr payback, and at 100% load to payback in 1 yr over the 150 [degrees] C transformer.",
        "Most 150 [degrees] C rise dry-type transformers are built with 220 [degrees] C insulation systems. Operating such a transformer at rated kVA on a continuous basis with a 30 [degrees] C average ambient should equate to a normal useful life. The 80 [degrees] C transformer requires operation at 75% or more of full load for a 2-yr payback, and at 100% load to payback in 1 yr over the 150 [degrees] C transformer.",
        "For example, if an insulation is rated at 105 [degrees] C maximum, the manufacturer must allow a 10 [degrees] C differential between average and hot spot temperatures in a winding. If the room ambient is 40 [degrees] C, then the allowable temperature rise is as follows. Average rise = 105 [degrees] C (hot spot) minus 10 [degrees] C minus 40 [degrees] C (ambient) = 55 [degrees] C. Thus the transformer must be capable of withstanding a 55 [degrees] C average temperature rise. The total maximum temperature allows for a maximum ambient of 40 [degrees] C. If the ambient temperature is below this, the transformer will run cooler; if above, it will run too hot, unless a special lower temperature rise design is used. Impregnation.",
        "Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: I used to design electrical rooms with a design temperature not to exceed about 80 deg F. This is for a typical electrical room with a couple of panels, a dry type transformer and communications gear. Source(s): Retired electrical engr. Banjo59 · 6 years ago. ",
        "The lower temperature rise transformers are more efficient, particularly at loadings of 50% and higher. Full load losses for 115 [degrees] C transformers are about 30% less than those of 150 [degrees] C transformers. The 80 [degrees] C transformer requires operation at 75% or more of full load for a 2-yr payback, and at 100% load to payback in 1 yr over the 150 [degrees] C transformer."

        "Dan Price, C.E.O. of Gravity Payments, surprised his 120-person staff by announcing that he planned over the next three years to raise the salary of every employee to $70,000 a year. The paychecks of about 70 employees will grow, with 30 ultimately doubling their salaries, according to Ryan Pirkle, a company spokesman. The average salary at Gravity is $48",
        "Dan Price, 30, announced this week that any employee at his company, Gravity Payments, making less than $70,000 annually will receive a $5,000-per-year raise or be paid a minimum of $50,000, whichever is greater. When Gravity launched, the company paid $24,000 per year even for senior positions. Price said he was paid less than that for the first five years in business. Today, the company, which pays an average salary of $48,000, has 120 employees -- and 70 of their paychecks will grow with this plan.",
        "Over the next three years, Gravity Payments will offer at least $70,000 salary to all of its 120 employees-even the most junior customer service representatives and clerks, CEO Dan Price told the New York Times this week. Price is slashing his own salary by 93percent-more depending on what portion of the company's profits he was planning to take home. Price founded Gravity Payments in 2004 when he was 19 and working out of his dorm room at Seattle Pacific University.",
        "Three months ago, Mr. Price, 31, announced he was setting a new minimum salary of $70,000 at his Seattle credit card processing firm, Gravity Payments, and slashing his own million-dollar pay package to do it. ",
        "1 Dan Price, founder of Gravity Payments, will slash his salary to $70,000 and raise the minimum wage for his 120 employees to $70,000. 2  The move, in the next three years, will also require Price to plow up to 80percent of his firm's $2.2million profits back into salaries. Price is slashing his own salary by 93percent-more depending on what portion of the company's profits he was planning to take home. Price founded Gravity Payments in 2004 when he was 19 and working out of his dorm room at Seattle Pacific University.",
        "The average salary for all employees as of this writing is $48,000 — so expect that average to fall exactly at $70,000 by 2018, at which point Price himself will drop his nearly $1 million per year salary down to $70,000 as well. As reported by the Inquisitr, CEO salaries are always a hotbed topic, usually making the news because of their hefty sums, not because of CEOs taking nearly $1 million salary cuts down to $70,000 per year.",
        "Three months ago, Gravity Payments raised its minimum salary to $70,000. Here's why the benevolent move hasn't pleased employees or stakeholders. While Price's decision to drop his own salary to $70,000 as part of the shift was admirable, Smith questioned the wisdom of Price's previous salary--nearly half of Gravity Payments' estimated $2.2 million projected net profit. I've never come near paying myself that percentage of my company's profits, Smith wrote.",
        "According to Fox, the new $70,000 minimum wage per year rule means that some Gravity Payments employees will experience a 100 percent increase in pay, seeing as though 30 of 120 employees on staff make approximately $35,000 or less per year working there. As reported by the Inquisitr, CEO salaries are always a hotbed topic, usually making the news because of their hefty sums, not because of CEOs taking nearly $1 million salary cuts down to $70,000 per year.",
        "comments. Dan Price, the CEO of Gravity Payments, is slashing his own salary 93percent. The CEO of a Seattle startup has instituted a $70,000 minimum wage at his credit card processing company-and he's paying for it by slashing his $1million salary to the same as his lowest-paid worker. Price is slashing his own salary by 93percent-more depending on what portion of the company's profits he was planning to take home. Price founded Gravity Payments in 2004 when he was 19 and working out of his dorm room at Seattle Pacific University."

Amyl nitrite can cause serious harmful effects if too much is inhaled.",
        "A Stacy Wiegman, PharmD, Pharmacy, answered. Amyl nitrite relaxes the smooth muscle that makes up your arteries and veins to allow increases in the flow of blood and oxygen to your heart. The chest pain that you feel during angina is caused by reduced blood flow to your heart. This happens if your heart does not get enough oxygen. ",

        "Poppers is slang for a variety of alkyl nitrites, particularly amyl nitrite. Poppers are available over-the-counter and come in small bottles. Amyl nitrites are generally used in air fresheners and video head cleaners, but are used as a recreational drug to increase sexual arousal. Poppers relax muscles such as the sphincter of the anus, which can make anal sex less painful. Poppers also cause blood vessels to dilate, which drops blood pressure and increases heart rate (amyl nitrite was originally used to treat angina and cyanide poisoning).",

        "Granite is a light-colored igneous rock with grains large enough to be visible with the unaided eye. It forms from the slow crystallization of magma below Earth’s surface. Granite is composed mainly of quartz and feldspar with minor amounts of mica, amphiboles and other minerals. This mineral composition usually gives granite a red, pink, gray or white color with dark mineral grains visible throughout the rock. Granite is a coarse-grained, light-colored igneous rock composed mainly of feldspars and quartz with minor amounts of mica and amphibole minerals. This simple definition enables students to easily identify the rock based upon a visual inspection.",
        "Granite forms deep underground from slow cooling magma, therefore, granite can be found as the base rock of most continents and as plutons beneath the surface. In areas where overlying rock and sediment have eroded away the material above these features, granite is exposed at the surface. Yosemite is a good example of exposed granitic plutons, and there are may other across the globe. Granite can also be found as erratic rocks in glacially transported till, widespread from previous periods of glaciation during ice ages.",
        "Granite countertops can also be found where there has been a significant amount of erosion, causing the deeper layers of the Earth's crust to be exposed. It is also believed that granite is produced from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks in a process called granitisation which involves heating and ionisation. Granite can be found underneath any large land mass, and is the core rock in all mountain ranges. Granite contains a large proportion of oxygen and silicon, the two most common elements on the earth's surface, making granite the most common rock on any continent"

        "Embryonic stem cells, as their name suggests, are derived from embryos. Most embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos that develop from eggs that have been fertilized in vitro —in an in vitro fertilization clinic—and then donated for research purposes with informed consent of the donors. Growing cells in the laboratory is known as cell culture. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are generated by transferring cells from a preimplantation-stage embryo into a plastic laboratory culture dish that contains a nutrient broth known as culture medium. The cells divide and spread over the surface of the dish."

The alumina in lateritic bauxite is mainly in the form of gibbsite, an aluminium oxide trihydrate. Other bauxites contain higher levels of boehmite are called monohydrates and involve significantly higher levels of energy to process. The three structural forms of bauxite are gibbsite, boehmite and diaspore. Gibbsite is a true aluminium hydroxide and boehmite and diaspore are both aluminium-oxide-hydroxides. Extreme lateritic weathering in the Darling Range has resulted in the formation of the trihydrate bauxite Al(OH)3, gibbsite (Refer Figure 1: Typical Darling Range Cross Section)",

It is a mixture of hydrous aluminum oxides, aluminum hydroxides, clay minerals and insoluble materials such as quartz, hematite, magnetite, siderite and goethite. The aluminum minerals in bauxite can include: gibbsite Al(OH) 3, boehmite AlO(OH), and, diaspore, AlO(OH). Bauxite is typically a soft (H:1-3), white to gray to reddish brown material with a pisolitic structure, earthy luster and a low specific gravity (SG: 2.0-2.5). In the Bayer Process the bauxite is washed in a hot solution of sodium hydroxide which leaches aluminum from the bauxite. The aluminum is precipitated out of solution in the form of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH) 3. The aluminum hydroxide is then calcined to form alumina, Al 2 O 3.",

In 2009, Australia was the top producer of bauxite with almost one-third of the world's production, followed by China, Brazil, India, and Guinea.

        "The liquorice plant is a herbaceous perennial legume native to southern Europe, India, and parts of Asia. It is not botanically related to anise, star anise, or fennel, which are sources of similar flavouring compounds. The word liquorice is derived (via the Old French licoresse) from the Greek γλυκύρριζα (glukurrhiza), meaning sweet root, from γλυκύς (glukus), sweet + ῥίζα (rhiza), root, the name provided by Dioscorides.",
        "Licorice is more than just a sweet treat. Along with being a sweet treat, licorice might also be good for your health. Licorice comes from root of the low-growing Glycyrrhiza glabra plant, which grows in parts of Greece and Turkey. The plant has been used throughout history for a host of medicinal purposes. ",
        "Making the world better, one answer at a time. If you are referring to natural licorice and not the candy in US stores, it comes from the root of the plant Glycyrrhiza glabra. It also does not taste the same as the candy which is flavored by anise instead",
        "Liquorice, or licorice, (/ˈlɪkᵊrɪʃ/ LIK-(ə-)rish or /ˈlɪkᵊrɪs/ LIK-(ə-)ris) is the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra from which a sweet flavour can be extracted.

        "Much of the sweetness in liquorice comes from glycyrrhizin, which has a sweet taste, 30–50 times the sweetness of sugar. The sweetness is very different from sugar, being less instant, tart, and lasting longer. The isoflavene glabrene and the isoflavane glabridin, found in the roots of liquorice, are phytoestrogens. The word liquorice is derived (via the Old French licoresse) from the Greek γλυκύρριζα (glukurrhiza), meaning sweet root, from γλυκύς (glukus), sweet + ῥίζα (rhiza), root, the name provided by Dioscorides.",
        "The sweetness in licorice comes from glycyrrhizin, a compound with pharmaceutical effects, that is more than 30x sweeter than sucrose. The licorice plant, an herbaceous perennial and legume, grows from three to seven feet and the taproot can reach a depth of four feet. The licorice plant is late blossoming, with purple and white flowers and maroon seed pods. The root is ready to harvest after three to five years",
        "Licorice Extract from the licorice plant is used to flavor candy licorice only. The candy such as Red Vines Black Licorice Twists have carbohydrates in them because they are … made of Molasses, Wheat Flour, Corn Syrup, Caramel Coloring, Licorice Extract, Salt, and Anise. If you are referring to natural licorice and not the candy in US stores, it comes from the root of the plant Glycyrrhiza glabra. It also does not taste the same as the candy which is flavored by anise instead",
        "Overview. Most people likely think of licorice as a sweet, chewy treat that is black or red. However, in candy, licorice flavoring -- which comes from the sweet root of the licorice plant, Glycyrrhiza glabra -- is only used in black licorice. Licorice powder is also used in tobacco products, teas and herbal supplements. ",
        "Licorice is a plant. You are probably most familiar with it as a flavoring in foods, beverages, and tobacco. The root is used to make medicine. Licorice is used for various digestive system complaints including stomach ulcers, heartburn, colic, and ongoing inflammation of the lining of the stomach (chronic gastritis). "

        "Gifts. According to the IRS, certain gifts are not taxable. These include gifts that are less than the annual exclusion amount. As of 2012, a married couple can give up to $26,000 tax-free, referred to as gift splitting.. If you pay tuition or medical expenses for someone, you don't have to pay tax on the money. ",
        "For deaths in 2015, everyone has a lifetime gift and estate tax exemption of $5.43 million, which means you can leave or give away up to $5.43 million without owing any federal tax. This amount goes up every year to adjust for inflation. Couples can combine their annual exclusions, meaning that they can give away $28,000 worth of property tax-free, per year, per recipient. In fact, even if only one spouse makes a gift, it's considered to have been made by both spouses if they both consent.",
        "In 2011, for example, tax-free gifts were capped at $13,000. You may give money to your spouse that exceeds the cap without incurring the gift tax. In addition, if you gave away $13,000 in cash in 2011, you might have had to pay the gift tax if you also passed some of your real estate property to another. ",
        "If you have 1,000 friends on whom you wish to bestow $14,000 each, you can give away $14 million a year without even having to fill out a federal gift-tax form. That $14 million would be out of your estate for good. If you give people a lot of money, you might have to pay a federal gift tax. But the IRS also allows you to give up to $14,000 in 2014 to any number of people without facing any gift taxes, and without the recipient owing any income tax on the gifts.",
        "But most gifts are not subject to the gift tax. For instance, you can give up to the annual exclusion amount ($14,000 in 2014) to any number of people every year, without facing any gift taxes. Recipients generally never owe income tax on the gifts. If you give people a lot of money, you might have to pay a federal gift tax. But the IRS also allows you to give up to $14,000 in 2014 to any number of people without facing any gift taxes, and without the recipient owing any",
        "For instance, if you give your daughter $20,000 on December 17, $6,000 of it is taxable. You'll have to file a gift tax return (by April 15 of the next year), and you'll use up $6,000 of the total amount you can give away or leave free from estate tax. But if you give your daughter $10,000 in December and wait to hand over the other $10,000 until January 1, both gifts are tax-free. Couples can combine their annual exclusions, meaning that they can give away $28,000 worth of property tax-free, per year, per recipient. In fact, even if only one spouse makes a gift, it's considered to have been made by both spouses if they both consent.",
        "In other words, if you aren't paid back, at least not fully, it's a gift. In 2014, you can give a lifetime total of $5.34 million in taxable gifts (that exceed the annual tax-free limit) without triggering the gift tax. Beyond the $5.34 million level, you would actually have to pay the gift tax. If you give people a lot of money, you might have to pay a federal gift tax. But the IRS also allows you to give up to $14,000 in 2014 to any number of people without facing any gift taxes, and without the recipient owing any income tax on the gifts.",
        "In 2015, a taxpayer can give up to $14,000 per person per year without being taxed on the gift. For example, this year you could give Friend A $14,000, Friend B $14,000, and your sister $14,000 and not be taxed on your gifts. Also, another way for parents to avoid the gift tax is to remember that each parent is entitled to their own individual $14,000 exclusion. This means that your mother and father could each give you $14,000 this year — for a total of $28,000 — without being taxed on that gift.",
        "The short answer to the question is as much as you like.. The IRS sets no cap on the total amount of money you can give your child each year. However, there are tax consequences for gifts over a certain amount, and the IRS imposes a lifetime $5.12 million gift tax exemption as well. In any given year, you can give up to $13,000 per child, without incurring any kind of reporting requirement, and without any gift tax liability. If you are married, you and your spouse can each give this amount, or $26,000 total. You can give more than this amount, but if you do, you must file an IRS Form 709."

        "English Ivy and Other Plants--Vertical Growth. While ivy roots are shallow and therefore less likely to cause severe damage to buildings than some other climbing vines, the wide spread of English ivy and the frequency of its air roots can make it a genuine menace to trees and large shrubs. The sticky substance that helps English ivy air roots cling to surfaces allows shoots to extend for 20 feet or more in search of sunlight and water for nourishment. Roots are very shallow, leaving a centipede-like pattern on stone, brick or stucco walls if removed.",
        "Roots and Shoots. English ivy relies on a combination of main, soil-based roots, which nourish the major stems of the plant, and air roots formed along the branches. As shoots form, air roots produce a sticky substance that helps them climb and adhere to surfaces, as well as contribute to plant photosynthesis. The sticky substance that helps English ivy air roots cling to surfaces allows shoots to extend for 20 feet or more in search of sunlight and water for nourishment. Roots are very shallow, leaving a centipede-like pattern on stone, brick or stucco walls if removed.",
        "Plant Roots. The root system of a plant constantly provides the stems and leaves with water and dissolved minerals. In order to accomplish this the roots must grow into new regions of the soil. The growth and metabolism of the plant root system is supported by the process of photosynthesis occurring in the leaves. Photosynthate from the leaves is transported via the phloem to the root system. Most monocots have fibrous root systems. Some fibrous roots are used as storage; for example sweet potatoes form on fibrous roots. Plants with fibrous roots systems are excellent for erosion control, because the mass of roots cling to soil particles.",
        "This type of root system usually pulls apart easily by hand when the entire plant is dug up, or you can remove clumps from the edge of the plant. Plunge two garden forks into the root mass between the shoots and push the handles in opposite directions to separate stubborn, matted hibiscus roots. A carrot is a good example of a taproot system, the root dives straight down into the soil. Fibrous systems form a wide, shallow mat of fine roots not too far from the surface of the soil -- grass is an example. Adventitious roots are those that develop wherever part of a plant touches soil and can help plants cling, climb and spread, as ivy does. Many plants have a combination of these system",
        "The root system itself is an organ system. Plants have two organ systems: the root system and the shoot system. The root system consists of the ground meristem, root cap, endo … dermis, epidermis, parenchyma, etc in the roots. The shoot system consists of the main stalk, branchings, leaves, etc. Answered. ",
        "The first root that comes from a plant is called the radicle. The four major functions of roots are 1) absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, 2) anchoring of the plant body to the ground, and supporting it, 3) storage of food and nutrients, 4) vegetative reproduction. 1 Most aerial roots and stilt roots are adventitious. 2  In some conifers adventitious roots can form the largest part of the root system. 3  Aerating roots (or knee root or knee or pneumatophores or Cypress knee): roots rising above the ground, especially above water such as in some mangrove genera (Avicennia, Sonneratia).",
        "The rate and thickness with which it spreads has led some to regard it as an invasive vine. Understanding the root system of English ivy helps you control this useful but aggressive plant and prevent damage to other plantings. The sticky substance that helps English ivy air roots cling to surfaces allows shoots to extend for 20 feet or more in search of sunlight and water for nourishment. Roots are very shallow, leaving a centipede-like pattern on stone, brick or stucco walls if removed.",
        "Ivy is able to do this by an aerial root system. These root structures release a sticky substance that allows the ivy to climb up a variety of surfaces, pr eferably ones that are rough and porous such as tree bark. Adhering discs develop on the stem, and the ivy is thoroughly attached to the surface. To pick up nutrients, the ivy spreads across large area of ground for surface nutrients, rather than using the soil nutrients from one specific location. Hedera helix does not have to share the soil space with other plants because as it spreads, the ivy takes over the space of other plants.",
        "This entry was posted on July 14, 2015 by Chris Link. The maple tree root system is one of the most important factors to consider before planting a maple tree in a home garden. Different types of maple trees have different types of root systems. "

It lowers the melting point of the ice on the roads so that it melts, even when the temperature is below 0ºC. Salt can also be mined by solution mining. This happens in Cheshire in the North West of England. Water is pumped underground and into the salt deposit. Salt dissolves in the water, forming a concentrated salt solution.

Folate is the term used for naturally occurring food folate and folic acid. Folic acid is used by the body for cellular reproduction. ",
        "Folic acid is found naturally in some foods, including leafy vegetables, citrus fruits, beans (legumes), and whole grains. Folic acid is added to foods that are labeled enriched, such as: 1  Breakfast cereals (Some have 100 percent of the Daily Value of folic acid in each serving). 2  Breads. 3  Flours. 4  Pastas. 5  Cornmeal.

        "Included in these ranked sources of folate are foods from various food groups, including vegetables, fruits, and legumes. Given this wide variety of choices, we are confident about your ability to develop a whole foods meal plan that will provide you with plenty of folate. Luckily, most of the B complex vitamins are found in the same plant foods that are rich in folate, so a diet rich in one is often rich in the others. The most important exception to this rule is also the B vitamin whose role is most entwined with folate.",
        "Folic acid is the form of folate found in fortified foods. Fortified foods are foods with added nutrients, usually vitamins and minerals. Folic acid also is the form of the vitamin found in dietary supplements. Check the Nutrition Facts panel on food labels to see which nutrients are listed. The word folate comes from the same Latin word as foliage or leaves. Some of the best food sources of folate are dark green leafy vegetables, like spinach, collards, and kale. Other foods high in folate are oranges and orange juice, legumes (dried beans and lentils), and peanuts. Fortified grain foods, like cereals and breads, contain the form of folate called folic acid. Figure 1. Kidney beans are one of many legumes, all of which contain folate",
        "Many fruits contain folic acid, but citrus fruits rank the highest. Oranges are an especially rich source of folic acid. One orange holds about 50 mcg, and a large glass of juice may contain even more. Other folate-rich fruits include papaya, grapefruit, grapes, banana, cantaloupe and strawberries. Sunflower seeds, flax seeds and peanuts are especially high in folate, with one cup offering up to 300 mcg.

        "Folate is found in whole foods and in your body, while folic acid is found in most vitamin supplements. Folic acid needs vitamin C, niacin, and vitamin B12 in order to be converted to its biologically active form. Interestingly, folic acid found in most vitamin supplements is more efficiently absorbed into your blood than folate. Because of this, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine created a unit called the Dietary Folate Equivalent (DFE) . 1  1 microgram (mcg) of folate found in food provides 1 mcg of DFE.",

Folate is found naturally in a wide variety of foods, including vegetables (especially dark green leafy vegetables), fruits and fruit juices, nuts, beans, peas, dairy products, poultry and meat, eggs, seafood, and grains (Table 2) [ 3, 7 ]. Mean dietary intakes of folate (including food folate and folic acid from fortified foods) range from 454 to 652 mcg DFE per day in U.S. adults of various ages and from 385 to 674 mcg DFE in children aged 1 to 18 years [ 16, 17 ]."

        "The misogyny in rap music is one such case. Misogyny in Hip Hop Culture refers to lyrics, videos or other aspects of hip hop culture that support, glorify, justify, or normalize the objectification, exploitation, or victimization of women. It can range from innuendoes to stereotypical characterizations and defamations. ",
        "A misogynist is someone who hates, dislikes or is prejudiced against women, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Unfortunately, those same people are usually unaware that their bias against women exists, which probably makes their misogyny grow. ",
        "Misogyny (/mɪˈsɒdʒɪni/) is the hatred or dislike of women or girls. Misogyny can be manifested in numerous ways, including sexual discrimination, belittling of women, violence against women, and sexual objectification of women. Misogyny can be found occasionally within ancient texts relating to various mythologies. According to sociologist Allan G. Johnson, misogyny is a cultural attitude of hatred for females because they are female..",
        "Misogyny .... is a central part of sexist prejudice and ideology and, as such, is an important basis for the oppression of females in male-dominated societies. Misogyny is manifested in many different ways, from jokes to pornography to violence to the self-contempt women may be taught to feel toward their own bodies. According to sociologist Allan G. Johnson, misogyny is a cultural attitude of hatred for females because they are female..",
        "Answer: A Misogynist is a person (often but not always a man) who hates women. Some psychoanalysts feel that it stems from the time when some men were boys and experienced a time earlier in their lives when they had a need to feel more masculine, and not so nurtured by their mothers as daughters do. Spelled correctly, misogyny means a hatred of women. A misogynist is a person full of hatred and dislike for women. Answer: Ironically, the previous answer is an example in tone and implication of misandry, misogyny's ugly opposite. Misogyny is a form of misanthropy, also seen in misandry.",
        "Submitted by Robert on September 29, 2015 - 8:19am. Everything is a choice but all of our choices are based on prior experiences from childhood on. To say men learn misogyny from what is around them is not a revelation but it stems from how they were raised, the attitudes of their parents and social structure. Why else would we have most major religions, racism, bigotry, misogyny etc. All of these things are learned behaviours. ",
        "No, misogyny is not simply hatred toward women. Imagine a society in which there are only 10 women. The 10 women gang rape Mr. Smith. As a result Mr. Smith justifiably comes to hate the 10 women. But they are all the women there are. So, Mr. Smith hates all women. But he is not thereby a misogynist. Misogyny involves hatred toward women or a type of woman for a particular reason. The reason is that the women the hatred is directed toward don't act in accordance with beliefs the misogynist has about how women should think and behave.",
        "Misogyny can be defined as the characterizing of women as bad or dangerous. However, for purposes of discussion about domestic abuse, a more useful definition is that misogyny is the characterization of feminine traits and female sexuality as bad and dangerous. "

        "Species interactions within ecological webs include four main types of two-way interactions: mutualism, commensalism, competition, and predation (which includes herbivory and parasitism). Because of the many linkages among species within a food web, changes to one species can have far-reaching effects. ",
        "Pollination is a classic example of mutualism. Mutualism is the way two organisms of different species exist in a relationship in which each individual benefits from the activity of the other. Similar interactions within a species are known as co-operation. Mutualism can be contrasted with interspecific competition, in which each species experiences reduced fitness, and exploitation, or parasitism, in which one species benefits at the expense of the other. Mutualism is a type of symbiosis. A well-known example of mutualism is the relationship between ungulates (such as bovines) and bacteria within their intestines. The ungulates benefit from the cellulase produced by the bacteria, which facilitates digestion; the bacteria benefit from having a stable supply of nutrients in the host environment.",
        "1. Parasitism: parasite benefits, host is hurt. Parasitism is a relationship in which one organism-the host-is the source of food and/or shelter for another organism, the parasite. In this relationship, all of the benefits go to the parasite; the host is harmed by the relationship. An example is a human and a tapeworm living in the intestines",
        "Symbiosis: Mutualism, Commensalism and Parasitism. Symbiosis is an interaction characterized by two or more species living purposefully in direct contact with each other. The term symbiosis includes a broad range of species interactions but typically refers to three major types: mutualism, commensalism and parasitism. Mutualism is a symbiotic interaction where both or all individuals benefit from the relationship.",
        "In many cases, both species benefit from the interaction. This type of symbiosis is called mutualism. An example of mutualism is the relationship between bullhorn acacia trees and certain species of ants. Let's review. In biology, symbiosis refers to a close, long-term interaction between two different species. But, there are many different types of symbiotic relationships. Mutualism is a type of symbiosis where both species benefit from the interaction. An example of mutualism is the relationship between bullhorn acacia trees and certain species of ants. The acacia provides food and shelter for the ants and the ants protect the tree",
        "• Mutualism: This can be used to describe an association in which both organisms apparently benefit. • Commensalism: In this association one organism [the commensal ] benefits, and the other [the host ] is apparently unaffected. • Parasitism In this association one organism [the parasite ] benefits, and the other [the host ] is adversely affected [weakened, sickened, damaged etc]. ",
        "Mutualism Mutualism-interaction between two or more species where both species benefit from one another Example-Clownfish and Sea Anemone (protection) Parasitism Parasitism-is the interaction between two organisms, in which one organism (the parasite) benefits and the other (the host) is harmed. Commensalism Commensalism-interaction between two organsisms where one benefits and the other is not affected. Example-Sea Cucumber and pearl fish. The pearl fish reproduces inside the sea cucumber and as an adult enters to hide from prey. Pollution and Conservation Pollution-the release of environmental contaminants."

        "Cerebral atrophy refers to the progressive loss of brain cells over time. Atrophy refers to a decreased size or wasting away of any part of the body. Cerebral atrophy can happen in either the entire brain or in just one part of the brain and can lead to decreased brain mass and loss of neurological function. The symptoms of cerebral atrophy depend on the cause and location of cell death. Cerebral atrophy can occur due to brain injury, as in the case of stroke, or to a neurological disease, such as Alzheimer’s disease, cerebral palsy, or Huntington’s disease. Infections of the brain can also lead to the death of brain cells and cerebral atrophy",

Atrophy can be generalized, which means that all of the brain has shrunk; or it can be focal, affecting only a limited area of the brain and resulting in a decrease of the functions that area of the brain controls.

Vitamins and minerals are essential to keeping goats healthy, making sure they're growing well, and assisting in reproduction and the development of skin and bone.",

        "Vitamin A: Inadequate amounts of Vitamin A in a goat's diet can lead to thick nasal discharge, difficulty in seeing or blindness, respiratory diseases, susceptibility to parasites, scruffy hair coat, and diarrhea. Kids with coccidiosis need more Vitamin A because they have reduced intestinal absorption of nutrients.",
        "Green plants provide beta-carotene, which provides vitamin A to a goat's diet. Boer goats store vitamin A in the liver, using the reserved vitamin when lacking greens in the diet. Vitamin D is absorbed through the skin of the goat while being outdoors. Sun-cured hay is a good source of providing vitamin D in the diet.

        "If that sounds like a lot of money, it is. It's also a lot of poker playing. $240,000 of tournament entries per year is $20,000 of tournament entries each month, or about $5,000 per week for 48 weeks of the year (with four weeks off for good behavior). $1,000 per day, five days a week, if you want a weekend. For every four dollars you put into tournament buy-ins, you make a dollar in profit. If you want to make $10,000 (in the long run), you need to play $40,000 worth of tournaments. Of course, $10,000 isn't really enough to live on.",
        "Even after rakeback, in the long run as much as 75% of poker players lose money. This is mostly due to the rake kicking in and a lot of bad play. So only something like 25% of the people who play poker are actually making any money from it in the long run. Being a professional poker player is kind of like being an astronaut or a rock star to most people. It is such an out of this world idea to them that they are naturally fascinated by those who do it. And with that of course they want to know how much money is involved.",
        "Recreational Players: Amateur poker players on the other hand can’t expect to make anywhere near this. Although it depends on the stakes involved – and how often you play, amateur poker players tend to make anything from zero to twenty thousand dollars per year. I put the limit at twenty thousand dollars because at this point amateur players become (or are considered) professional.",
        "Another rarely discussed, yet very serious, downside to being a professional poker player is that it causes you to greatly devalue money. If you compare a lawyer who makes $500/hr with a poker player who makes $500/hr, the poker player will never have anywhere near as much value for the money as the lawyer does. For a professional poker player to average $500/hr, he has to be playing fairly high stakes games in which you are winning and losing sums between $10,000 and $100,000 on an hourly basis.",
        "Salary. A professional poker player's pay is determined by his performance, so it's difficult to establish an exact average annual salary. In 2010, the top 20 wage-earning professional poker players took home an average salary of $1.58 million in 2010. This represents the earnings of a tiny group of players at the top of the earnings bracket; the average salary earned among all professional poker players was $15,000 as of 2011. Buy-in costs for World Series of Poker events can be as much as $10,000, but the prize money is generally greater than $1 million. The player could also be responsible for travel expenses.",
        "When asking how much poker players make, the figure largely depends on how good you are, how often you play and where abouts you play (including the stakes involved). A large proportion of online poker players make $50-$100k per year. Others – many of whom are still relatively unknown, can easily make $200,000 per year. An good NL100 player, for example, can spin up to $80,000 per year in online poker. Amateur poker players on the other hand can’t expect to make anywhere near this. Although it depends on the stakes involved – and how often you play, amateur poker players tend to make anything from zero to twenty thousand dollars per year.",
        "Best Answer: It's so hard to answer that. On the one end of the scale you have the grinders that grind out $10 or $20 an hour. On the other end you have those who sit in the big game at the Bellagio and play $1000/$2000 blinds. You have cash game experts and tournament experts. Those that play small tournaments others that play the big ones that cost $10,000 or more to enter. Some poker players can make several million dollars a year, whereas others make just enough to live off. Some make a fortune and squander it almost as quickly gambling. ",
        "His ITM is 16% (the same as Moorman’s) however his ROI is 17%. If you’re interested in how much professional online tournament players make, Shaub Deen (winner of the PokerStars tournament leader board 2007+2008) has a lifetime MTT ROI of 62%. However this is nothing in comparison to JhonnyBax’s 88%. "

Instead, you may need to refresh pivot tables or even completely recreate the tables after data changes in order to reflect the most current information.",

The most obvious benefit of using pivot tables is reporting flexibility-you can view your data grouped any way you like all with a simple drag, drop, point and click interface. This leads to a further benefit-spreadsheets with pivot tables are more simple than intensive formula driven reports. Possibly the most useful aspect of pivot tables is the design discipline they enforce by separating the actual data from the view(s) of the data. Many people are blocked from experiencing the true power of pivot tables because their data is already half pivoted.",

It is the traditional cut-pile carpet, with fibers standing straight up, and cut to even lengths. It is generally not as long as a frieze, but stands higher than most berbers or cut-and-loops. One other point about saxony is that it can be very deceiving when it comes to quality. It can be tricky to tell the grade of the carpet just by looks-what appears to be a full, dense carpet can sometimes just be a relatively few number of fibers 'puffed up'.",

The carpet’s elegant appearance, on the other hand, comes from its tufts created when the strands of yarn are twisted together and set with heat. One of Saxony’s greatest drawbacks is its tendency to show footprints and vacuum trails. Many consumers ask for Saxony carpet at their local carpet retailer, but don’t really know what exactly they are referring to. While they’ve heard Saxony is a high quality carpet, they don’t realize Saxony could be referring to a brand or a type of construction.",

The mass of an electron is very small (9.108 X 10 -28 grams). Both the protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus. Protons have a postive (+) charge, neutrons have no charge --they are neutral. Electrons reside in orbitals around the nucleus. They have a negative charge (-). It is the number of protons that determines the atomic number, e.g., H = 1.

Imitations and natural earth pigments lie very close together-natural earth pigments are colored by iron oxydation, a process that's easily reproduced in a lab. Manufactured iron oxyde oil painting colors are very stable as well. Underpainting techniques are usually done with earth colors, because they provide the painting with a natural basis. Every earth color has it's own function, in this respect, which was developed through the ages. If you use one earth color and white, to tone your other (prismatic) oil painting colors, it connects the other colors and makes them look natural. The earth tone functions as a unifier. Earth colors are simple paints, and the cheapest ones will do just fine"

Two Tylenol can be taken every 6 hours as well, but it may be best to stagger these 3 hours after the last ibuprofen dosage. For severe pain, take the tablets prescribed as directed. The prescribed pain medicine will make you groggy and will slow down your reflexes.

        "A RealAge answered. When you have a toothache, an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help ease discomfort (but never put aspirin against the gums near the toothache, as this may burn the gum tissue). Rinsing your mouth with warm salt water can ease gum swelling. A topical anesthetic may also help. If there’s an infection, pain medication won’t make that go away and it could spread to cause more problems. That said, over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin can all reduce the pain, but none of these treats the cause.",

        "Most dinners on the cruises are cruise casual. For what the cruises call dress-up night, men should wear a jacket and women should wear a dress or pantsuit. Semi-formal dress is very similar to the dress-up night clothing. Men should wear a jacket or a suit, and women should again wear a dress or pantsuit. Definitions. Disney cruises have four types of dressing other than casual: cruise casual, dress-up, semi-formal and formal. For cruise casual, avoid shorts, swimwear, casual t-shirts and tank tops. Long pants (jeans are fine), skirts and collared shirts (including Aloha shirts and golf/polo shirts) are appropriate",

The longer your cruise, the more formal attire nights you will have..Mostly they are casual/smart casual though.. Usually, when you spend a day at sea, that is more likely to be your formal attire night. Some are pickier than others. We chose Norwegian Cruise Lines' Pearl to go on (to Alaska) because of the relaxed atmosphere. You don't technically have to dress up for dinner, but it's nice to, and fun, too. If you just go to the buffet every time, then no, you never have to dress up at all.",

SUMMARY: The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (a spending bill) and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (a tax bill) legislated the elimination of the annual budget deficit by 2002. In the end, tax revenues were increasing at such a rate that the federal budget went into surplus several years ahead of schedule in FY 1998 and continued in surplus in 1999, 2000, and 2001. FURTHER INFORMATION: Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. Law No.: 105-33).",
        "Balanced-budget provisions have been added to the constitutions of most U.S. states, the Basic Law of Germany, the Hong Kong Basic Law, Spain, Italy and the Swiss Constitution. It is often proposed that a balanced-budget rule be added to the national United States Constitution. After years of rising deficits and debt in the 1990s, Switzerland's citizens adopted the debt brake as a constitutional amendment in 2001. The rule was implemented starting in 2003. It states that each year, the budget must be in balance, adjusted for economic conditions.",
        "Now for the bad news for GOP partisans. The federal budget has not been balanced by any Republican spending reductions. Uncle Sam now spends $150 billion more than in 1995. Over the past 10 years, the defense budget, adjusted for inflation, has been cut $100 billion, but domestic spending has risen by $300 billion. We have a balanced budget today that is mostly a result of 1) an exceptionally strong economy that is creating gobs of new tax revenues and 2) a shrinking military budget. Part of the explanation for the balanced budget is that Republicans in Congress had the common sense to reject the most reckless features of Clintonomics. Just this year, Bill Clinton’s budget proposed more than $100 billion in new social spending — proposals that were mostly tossed overboard.",
        "Signed into law by President Clinton on August 5, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (H.R. 2015) was heralded for its bipartisan commitment to balance the federal budget by the year 2002. However, equally momentous are the broad policy changes made to the federal entitlement programs that are affected by the new law. MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 advances mental health coverage through the new childrens health initiative and Medicaid. No state is required to provide a mental health benefit in the new childrens health insurance program.",
        "In 2009 Germany 's constitution was amended to introduce the Schuldenbremse (debt brake) , a balanced budget provision. This will apply to both the federal government and the Laender (Länder german). States from 2016 onwards the federal government will be forbidden to run a structural deficit of more than.035 % OF. gdp After years of rising deficits and debt in the 1990s, Switzerland's citizens adopted the debt brake as a constitutional amendment in 2001.

Finishing a 700 square foot basement may cost a homeowner between $31,500 and $45,500 to create an additional functional, beautiful and useable living space. This cost to finish a basement per square foot is about half the cost of building an addition of the same size onto your home. According to Remodeling Magazine, a Basement Remodel has a 77.6% cost-to-value ratio. Say, you got to pay $20,000 more to finish a basement to a house you pay $600,000 with 20% down, then you need to have $120k for downpayment, plus another $20k to do the work.

By reducing the viscosity (thickness) of the blood, enzymes improve circulation. Proteolytic enzymes, such as bromelain, papain, pancreatin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and rutin, are essential regulators and modulators of the inflammatory response.

        "Share to: The acidity of the tomato sauce helps lasagna keep fresh for a longer time than say, macaroni salad. However, it should be refrigerated no more than two or three hours after … it has been served (counting that it will sit for 15 to 30 minutes after coming out of the oven). ",
        "How long does lasagna last? Lasagna, although there are many variations, is most often made with tomato sauce, ground beef, lasagna noodles or pasta and ricotta cheese. The shelf life of lasagna depends on a variety of factors, such as possibly a best by date, the preparation method and how the lasagna was stored. ",
        "1 If you're just reheating an individual piece of lasagna, you can do it in the microwave instead of in the oven. 2  Place it on a microwave-safe dish and microwave on high for 2 - 3 minutes, or until it's hot and bubbly. 3  Do not use aluminum foil in the microwave. ",
        "Leftovers can be kept for three to four days in the refrigerator. Be sure to eat them within that time. After that, the risk of food poisoning increases. If you don't think you'll be able to eat leftovers within four days, freeze them immediately. Food poisoning — also called foodborne illness — is caused by harmful organisms, such as bacteria in contaminated food. Your goal is to minimize the time a food is in the danger zone — between 40 and 140 F (4 and 60 C) — when bacteria can quickly multiply. When you're ready to eat leftovers, reheat them on the stove, in the oven or in the microwave until the internal temperature reaches 165 F (74 C).",
        "GRAVY & BROTH: Cooked gravy and broth will stay fresh and safe to eat for 1-2 days in your refrigerator. Freeze it into ice cube trays and you’ll have a handy burst of flavor to add to your next meal. PASTA: Cooked pasta keeps for 3-5 days in the refrigerator, although pasta in soups will swell after the first day. SALADS: Egg, tuna, ham, chicken and macaroni salads can be kept safely for 3-5 days. Un-dressed green salads and cut vegetables can be kept this long as well, and no salads freeze well – so eat it up! SEAFOOD: Seafood leftovers can be kept only 2 days in the refrigerator, and will taste better if consumed in 1 day.",
        "Report Abuse. You can freeze some if you like. I'd transfer it to an airtight container or wrap in foil and then put it in a freezer bag. Your lasagna should keep for four or five days in the back of the fridge. If food has been left out for more than two hours, as a general rule, it should be discarded (it depends on the monitoring of the temperature...but up to 6) . When eating leftovers, the USDA advises reheating them to 325 degrees F. Reheating food to 325 degrees F or a higher temperature will eliminate bacteria.",
        "Any cooked, refrigerated food will last 3-4 days. Bear in mind, while the lasagna may be safe to eat, the food may deterioate after a a couple of days. Consider freezing left over food. Freezing food will keep it safe and edible for several weeks. Use proper freezer bags or container",
        "You’ve followed the recipe, enjoyed your feast, and there’s still leftover food…. DO-Freeze the remaining food. It will keep fine for a month or two, whether meat-filled or vegetarian.

        "Edsel Bryant Ford, the only child of Henry Ford and his wife Clara, was born November 6, 1893, in Detroit, Michigan. A decade after Edsel’s birth, Henry Ford (1863-1947) established the Ford Motor Company; five years later, he introduced the Model T, an affordable car for the masses. His father then resumed the presidency of the company. Edsel’s oldest son, Henry Ford II, succeeded his grandfather as head of Ford in 1945. In the 1950s, the Ford company launched the Edsel car division, named for its second president.",
        "Marketing research and development for the new intermediate line had begun in 1955 under the code name E car, which stood for experimental car.. Ford Motor Company eventually decided on the name Edsel, in honor of Edsel B. Ford, son of the company's founder, Henry Ford (despite objections from Henry Ford II). Ford Motor Company had conducted the right marketing study, but it came up with the wrong product to fill the gap between Ford and Mercury. By 1958, buyers had become fascinated with economy cars, and a large car like the Edsel was seen as too expensive to buy and own.",
        "At the heart of any big flop–like when Ford ended the Edsel 55 years ago, on Nov. 19, 1959–lies high expectations. The Edsel was named after Henry Ford’s son, no small honor, and it had its own division of the company devoted to its creation. As TIME reported in 1957 when the car debuted, the company had spent 10 years and $250 million on planning one of its first brand-new cars in decades. ",
        "Condensed from several articles in 1989, by Edsel owner Ron Osborn. Drawings by Harry Bradley. I have prepared a short story on the life of Edsel Ford. As most of us know, Edsel died in May, 1943, so it seemed fitting to honor the man on the 46th anniversary of his death, who's car and club are named after him.",
        "Edsel Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, US, as the only child of Clara and Henry Ford, being named for Edsel Ruddiman, one of Henry Ford's closest childhood friends. Edsel was groomed to take over the family automobile business, and grew up tinkering on cars with his father. Edsel worked closely with his father, as sole heir to the business, but was keen to develop cars more exciting than the Model T (Tin Lizzie), in line with his personal tastes. Even as president, he had trouble persuading the older man to allow any departure from this formula.",
        "The name of the car, Edsel, is also often cited as a further reason for its unpopularity. Naming the vehicle after Edsel Ford was proposed early in its development, however the Ford family strongly opposed its use, Henry Ford II stating that he didn't want his father's good name spinning around on thousands of hubcaps. The Edsel was a make of automobile manufactured by the Ford Motor Company during the 1958, 1959, and 1960 model years. The car brand is best known as one of the most spectacular failures in the history of the United States automobile industry.",
        "That car became the Edsel, named after Henry Ford's son. At first known only as the E car, the Edsel was given a significant amount of publicity from Ford for its launch in September of 1957, and even had its own television special to help market the new car to the buying public. ",
        "Edsel Bryant Ford (November 6, 1893 – May 26, 1943) was the only son of Henry Ford and president of Ford Motor Company from 1919 to his death in 1943. His eldest son was Henry Ford II. Edsel worked closely with his father, as sole heir to the business, but was keen to develop cars more exciting than the Model T (Tin Lizzie), in line with his personal tastes. Even as president, he had trouble persuading the older man to allow any departure from this formula.",
        "The Edsel was an automobile marque that was planned, developed, and manufactured by the Ford Motor Company during the 1958, 1959, and 1960 model years. Ford Motor Company had conducted the right marketing study, but it came up with the wrong product to fill the gap between Ford and Mercury. By 1958, buyers had become fascinated with economy cars, and a large car like the Edsel was seen as too expensive to buy and own.",
        "Edsel was the only child of Henry and Clara Ford. After his death, Henry Ford returned to his former position as president of Ford Motor Company. Today, Edsel's legacy lives on in his contributions to the design of Lincoln cars and his generous backing of art in Detroit. "

        "Benzene is one of a small number of industrial chemicals that is recognized as a known human carcinogen. Benzene is especially toxic to the blood-forming organs, i.e., the bone marrow and other organs that can produce blood cells. What is Benzene? Benzene is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon; it has 6 carbon atoms and 6 hydrogen atoms in a hexagonal (ring) structure. Discovered by the English scientist Michael Faraday in 1825, it was named benzene in 1845 by A.W. von Hofmann, the German chemist, who detected it in coal tar.",
        "Benzene Health Effects: Acute and Chronic. Benzene is a toxic chemical that occurs naturally in the environment but is also used by man in a wide range of products. Exposure to this chemical can result in a range of side effects, which can be acute or chronic, and can be deadly. Long term exposure or high level exposure to benzene can result in a number of ailments, and this chemical has been branded a class A carcinogenic by the Environmental Protection Agency.",
        "Benzene is an important organic chemical compound with the chemical formula C 6 H 6. Its molecule is composed of 6 carbon atoms joined in a ring, with 1 hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom. Because its molecules contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon. Benzene is a natural constituent of crude oil, and is one of the most elementary petrochemicals. Benzene is an aromatic hydrocarbon and the second [ n ]- annulene ([6]-annulene), a cyclic hydrocarbon with a continuous pi bond.",
        "Workers in industries that make or use benzene may be exposed to high levels of this chemical. These include the rubber industry, oil refineries, chemical plants, shoe manufacturers, and gasoline-related industries. Benzene is also used to make some types of lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, and pesticides. Other people who may be exposed to benzene at work include steel workers, printers, lab technicians, gas station employees, and firefighters. Benzene is known to cause cancer, based on evidence from studies in both people and lab animals. The link between benzene and cancer has largely focused on leukemia and cancers of other blood cells.",
        "Human exposure to benzene has been associated with a range of acute and long-term adverse health effects and diseases, including cancer and aplastic anaemia. Exposure can occur occupationally and domestically as a result of the ubiquitous use of benzene-containing petroleum products, including motor fuels and solvents. 7  Benzene is a moderate eye irritant and a skin irritant. Benzene is a well-established cause of cancer in humans. Chronic exposure to benzene can reduce the production of both red and white blood. cells from bone marrow in humans, resulting in",

Benzene is also a natural part of crude oil, gasoline, and cigarette smoke. Benzene is widely used in the United States; it ranks in the top 20 chemicals for production volume. Some industries use benzene to make other chemicals which are used to make plastics, resins, and nylon and synthetic fibers.",
        "Eating or drinking foods containing high levels of benzene can cause vomiting, irritation of the stomach, dizziness, sleepiness, convulsions, rapid heart rate, and death. The major effect of benzene from long-term exposure is on the blood. Benzene causes harmful effects on the bone marrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells leading to anemia. It can also cause excessive bleeding and can affect the immune system, increasing the chance for infection. Benzene is also used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, and pesticides. Natural sources of benzene include emissions from volcanoes and forest fires. Benzene is also a natural part of crude oil, gasoline, and cigarette smoke.",

When he used the word it meant something like ‘barbarous’, as well as ‘deriving from the Middle Ages’. The Mysteries of Udolpho In the 1790s, novelists rediscovered what Walpole had imagined. The doyenne of Gothic novelists was Ann Radcliffe, and her most famous novel, The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) took its title from the name of a fictional Italian castle where much of the action is set.",

One can trace elements of the Gothic novel in earlier novels such as Ferdinand Count Fathom by Tobias Smollett, published in 1753; but the first full-fledged Gothic novel was The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole, which appeared in 1764. The Gothic novel is a form of fiction which became popular in England in the second half of the eighteenth century.",
        "The novel usually regarded as the first Gothic novel is Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, first published in 1764. Horace Walpole's declared aim was to combine elements of the medieval romance, which he deemed too fanciful, and the modern novel, which he considered to be too confined to strict realism. The name Gothic refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating Gothic architecture, in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German Schauerroman and the French ¨Georgia¨.",

He wrote it based on a dream he had, in which he found himself in an ancient castle. … Other authors of Gothic novels used his ideas and themes to write their own stories later on. The Dickens' novel Hard Times was first published as a serial novel between April 1 and August 12, 1854. This was in the weekly Household Words publication as twenty equal pa … rts. It was also published as a complete volume in August of 1854.",

        "Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus was first published in London, England in 1818. It contains elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement. It was also a warning against the “over-reaching” of modern man and the Industrial Revolution. "

Tufa is a rock composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) that forms at the mouth of a spring, from lake water, or from a mixture of spring and lake water. Tufas in the Pyramid Lake subbasin were first mentioned in scientific literature by Fremont (1845), who erroneously believed they had formed above water. Tufa mounds formed when springs discharged from the bottom of Pyramid Lake, supplying calcium that combined with carbonate dissolved in lake water to form the mounds.",
        "From reliable sources, we know that the mineral that makes up the tufa formations is called tufa (!), and is a form of calcium carbonate (chemical formula CaCO 3). Tufa is an unusual form of calcium carbonate. Limestone (also CaCO 3), for instance, is very common rock in the Earth's crust formed at the bottom of large bodies of water. As skeletons of microscopic organisms heavier than water pile up on the bottom over long periods of time, they may become cemented by pressure.",
        "Tufa is a kind of limestone that is very common in Italy. Tufa is very soft when it is first cut from the ground, so it is easy to work with. It's not soft like butter, but it is easier to cut than harder stones like granite. (with an Etruscan inscription on it). Tufa is a kind of limestone that is very common in Italy.

Oil leaks from oil pan, front seals and cam seals are more expensive. One of the more expensive seals would be the rear oil seal. Just depends on where it's leaking from. it depends where the leak is and from what part. a worn out gasket is inexpensive to replace, a leak from engine-transmission or transmission-drive shafts it might be a bit more expensive. in any case, the labor might be up to 75% of the total cost (parts are usually less expensive).",

        "What Insulin Does. Specifically, insulin allows the cells in the muscles, fat and liver to absorb glucose that is in the blood. The glucose serves as energy to these cells, or it can be converted into fat when needed. Insulin also affects other metabolic processes, such as the breakdown of fat or protein. ",
        "Your cells cannot use glucose without insulin, a hormone secreted from the beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin helps the cells take in glucose and convert it to energy. Insulin affects several organs and tissues to promote glycogen storage and laying down of fat. Glucose, some amino-acids, and to a much lesser extent fat all promote insulin release. In the liver, insulin increases glucose transport into the liver from the blood, and the synthesis of glycogen. In muscle the effects are similar and in fact the amount of glucose taken up by muscle is a significant contributor to the total glucose disposal rate (GDR). In adipocytes, insulin promotes synthesis of fat",

        "Continue ReadingPatient Guide to Insulin: About Diabetes. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows your body to use sugar (glucose) from carbohydrates in the food that you eat for energy or to store glucose for future use. Insulin helps keeps your blood sugar level from getting too high (hyperglycemia) or too low (hypoglycemia). ",
        "Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that helps the body store and use glucose. Think of insulin as the U.S. Postal Service and glucose as the mail; insulin is responsible for delivering that glucose (sugar) from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, liver, and most other cells so that your body can use it for fuel. Insulin is a hormone produced and secreted by the pancreas or administered by injection, that is necessary for glucose (in the blood) to be transported into cells where it is converted into energy. The only tissues that do not require insulin to transport glucose into cells are the brain and heart",
        "Insulin has several broad actions including: 1  It causes the cells in the liver, muscle, and fat tissue to take up glucose from blood and convert it to glycogen that can be stored in the liver and muscles. 2  Insulin also prevents the utilization of fat as an energy source. 1 In absence of insulin or in conditions where insulin is low glucose is not taken up by body cells, and the body begins to use fat as an energy source. 2  Insulin also controls other body systems and regulates the amino acid uptake by body cells. 3  It has several other anabolic effects throughout the body as well.",
        "Insulin (from the Latin, insula meaning island) is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells in the pancreas. It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats by promoting the absorption of glucose from the blood to skeletal muscles and fat tissue and by causing fat to be stored rather than used for energy. ",
        "A. Insulin stimulates the cells of the body to absorb sugar (glucose) out of the blood. It also inhibits the production of glucose by the liver. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not make insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to the insulin the body does make. All people with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin injections."

        "An advanced manufacturing approach for lithium-ion batteries, developed by researchers at MIT and at a spinoff company called 24M, promises to significantly slash the cost of the most widely used type of rechargeable batteries while also improving their performance and making them easier to recycle. “The new method brings the benefits of liquid technology to big batteries—but without the baggage.”. Professor Yet-Ming Chiang’s company 24M has devised a manufacturing process that cuts the cost of producing batteries in half using liquid-battery technology, writes Brooks Hays for UPI.",
        "The machine would have a capacity of 79 megawatt-hours a year and produce any kind of lithium-ion battery for a cost of about $160 per kilowatt-hour. By 2020, Chiang says, that will be down to about $85, 30% below where conventional lithium-ion batteries—whose cost is also dropping—may be by then. But most importantly, the machine would be priced at about $11 million. Hence, the startup cost of getting into lithium-ion battery manufacturing would plummet. Manufacturers are secretive, but analysts say a lithium-ion battery pack costs an average of roughly $500 per kilowatt-hour, a measure of the energy a battery can store. That’s four times the price needed to compete directly with gasoline. Only about 30% of that $500 is the cost of materials.",
        "The cost of the battery is only ~10-20% higher than the bill of materials – suggesting a potential long-term competitive price for Lithium Ion batteries could approach ~$100 per kWh. Tesla currently pays Panasonic $180/kW for their batteries, although conventional systems still selling for $500-700/kWh. If I spent $100 for a kWh of battery capacity I would need 1031 cycles of 1 kWh to equal $100 of capital cost. It is kind of hard to connect the dots in a useful way, but the battery cost is getting to be in the neighborhood of useful. I think in some places in the US residential power is 20 cents a kWh.",
        "The largest investment cost is for the installed capital equipment. Each cost item for the battery under design is adjusted from the estimate of the baseline plant. The plant cost is done in a similar way with a cost of $3,000 per square meter ($280/sq. ft) including land and utilities. The goal for average battery life is 15 years and a warranted life of 10 years, with full replacement in the first five years and shared cost of replacement for the last five years seems appropriate. The vehicle owner would pay an increasing share of the cost from between 0 % at 5 years to 100 % at 10 or more years.",
        "There are certainly non-negligible differences between wage expense for U.S. and Chinese battery manufacturing plants; total labor cost in China for a fully automated plant with a capacity of 350 million cells per year represents only 3% of product cost, compared with 12.5% of total cost in the United States. This study compares the costs of manufacturing high-performance 18650-size lithium-ion cells in China and",
        "What is being mixed up here is the incremental cost of grid power (I pay $0.097/kWh) and the capital cost to havethe system in place. If I spent $100 for a kWh of battery capacity I would need 1031 cycles of 1 kWh to equal $100 of capital cost. It is kind of hard to connect the dots in a useful way, but the battery cost is getting to be in the neighborhood of useful. I think in some places in the US residential power is 20 cents a kWh.",
        "24M is focusing on large-scale grid storage for the time being, but the implications for electric automobiles are obvious. Chiang predicts that, by 2020, the cost of his batteries will be down to around $85 per kWh. Most experts say that the changeover from fossil fuel cars to battery cars for mainstream buyers will take place when battery prices fall below $100 per kWh. ",
        "An article on Thursday about Tesla Motors’ plans for a large-scale lithium-ion battery factory misstated the expected production capacity of the factory. By 2020, it is expected to produce enough batteries for 500,000 cars annually, not 500,000 batteries. ",
        "The average $500-700/kWh for a typical battery is probably closer to the $2,000-3,000/kW when including the balance of the system costs (around $400-500/kW), with a trend towards around $1,500/kW within the next 3-years. If I spent $100 for a kWh of battery capacity I would need 1031 cycles of 1 kWh to equal $100 of capital cost. It is kind of hard to connect the dots in a useful way, but the battery cost is getting to be in the neighborhood of useful. I think in some places in the US residential power is 20 cents a kWh.",
